A Data Management System (DMS) is a framework. It can be used to create a variety of solutions such as Data Portals, Data Catalogs, Data Lakes (or Data Meshes) etc. A DMS does many things, as shown in the schematic below. For the project I am currently working on the DMS will primarily serve as a portal (online access point) into data/metadata storage with viz+dashboard that is secure (permission).

One of the most popular implementations is CKAN, an opensourced DMS created in 2007 and is activie developed and mainatend. Many NGO and government organizations use CKAN (for example [the US open data.gov site](https://www.data.gov/)) because it is open sourced (free to develop and has many assibile repository examples) and has precdent as a trusted implementation for a powerful DMS. This CKAN tech stack involved in building a CKAN DMS is quite extensive but it contains several skills which I have been working with (Linux, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS) and several skillsets that I haven't had practical experience in but would love to get better at (PostGres, Django, Docker, Azure).

Why this blog series? Writing things down helps me formalize my thoughts and helps me learn. Plus as a developer memorizing everything you need to know just isn't practical; these blogs will also serve as a reference down the line for me and hopefull for others as well. The content will not be from first principle but rather what I/you need to know. They will probably be short 'what did I learn' type things for specific pieces of the project (e.g. my first blog will go into Docker installation); while there may be tutorials for these things online, I find most of them to not be beginer friendly.
