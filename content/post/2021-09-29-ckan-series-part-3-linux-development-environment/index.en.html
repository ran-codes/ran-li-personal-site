<p>Disclaimer… not an expert at CKAN.</p>
<p>According to their <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/installing/index.html">installation documentation</a> it sounds like I should install CKAN from source since it is the most customization vs package installation and should have a easier deployment process vs Docker Compose (<a href="https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/maintaining/installing/deployment.html">source install deployment</a>).</p>
<p>CKAN runs on Linux and since we will be installing from source and not via docker. It’s good to invest some time in setting a efficient Linux environment instead of working all day on command line: Ubuntu Desktop/Virtual Box, VS Code for text editting, GitHub Desktop for version control. Also since CKAN is built on Django/python (I think???) add a Django/Python IDE (going to try pyCharm).</p>

<h3>Ubuntu/Virtual Box</h3>
<p>I installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and run it using VirtualBox as per the instructions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc&amp;ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Python Dev Environment</h3>
<p>Pycharm seems like what I would eventually use (high functionality) but its not very lightweight, particularly for use in a virtual environment that isn’t as powerful as host. Perhaps I install two things, one IDE (e.g. Pycharm) then just another text editor (e.g. sublime). Seems reasonable… let’s try and figure things our as we go.</p>
